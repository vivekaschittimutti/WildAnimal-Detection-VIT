Wild Animal Detection Using Vision Transformers

Overview

Wild animal detection plays a crucial role in preventing human-wildlife conflicts and ensuring the safety of both animals and humans. This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning model using Vision Transformers (ViTs) to detect and classify wild animals from real-time camera feeds. The model is designed to enhance wildlife monitoring and alert systems.

Project Goals

.Enhance global feature learning to improve adaptability across diverse environments and animal species.

.Utilize larger datasets to improve generalization and detection performance.

.Ensure robustness for different environments, including varying lighting, backgrounds, and weather conditions.
